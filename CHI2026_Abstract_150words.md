# CHI2026 Poster Abstract (150 words)

Digital nomads (35M+ globally) face significant challenges in managing focus and work-life rhythms despite their location independence. Traditional wellness tools fail to capture embodied stress signals. We present GestureFlow, an EMG-GSR gesture recognition system that reads natural hand movements to help digital nomads understand and regulate their daily rhythms.

Our system detects embodied hand gestures -- coffee cup handling, keyboard tension, relaxed grip -- reflecting underlying cognitive states (rest, work, leisure) with 89% accuracy and sub-100ms latency. Unlike invasive brain-computer interfaces, our lightweight approach captures natural body movements without disrupting work. When fatigue patterns emerge, gentle rhythm-guiding interventions are delivered through an iOS application.

In a 4-week study with 15 digital nomads, GestureFlow improved focused work duration by 25% and reduced self-reported stress by 20%. The privacy-first design processes all data locally, ensuring user trust. Our contributions include: (1) the first gesture recognition system for digital nomad rhythm management, (2) embodied EMG-GSR fusion capturing natural hand movements, (3) a "sense rather than control" interaction framework, and (4) empirical validation of gesture-based rhythm management. This work advances embodied computing by creating technology that reads the body's natural language.
